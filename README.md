### Zdravstvuyte ðŸ‘‹
I'm a student from St. Petersburg, studying **Software Development**. <br><br>
I'm into **C++/C#** development, have a good grasp of OOP basics, and I'm familiar with Python, JS, Databases (LiteSQL, PostgreSQL), and Bash. **I use Arch btw :3**, but I have to use Windows too. I'm also learning about neural networks and enjoy tinkering with them locally.<br><br>
I have a lot of fun messing with phone firmware â€“ **ROOT, custom firmware, Magisk modules**, and all that jazz. Over several years of diving deep into Android, I've flashed dozens of custom ROMs, recovered soft and hard bricks, dealt with lost IMEIs, swapped them with other phones, and tackled many other fun challenges. It's a shame they're tightening the screws now, blocking bootloader unlocks and EDL access :(. <br>I've also tinkered with routers via console and Entware â€“ flashing custom firmware, overclocking, setting up VPNs, and bypassing traffic blocking (zapret).<br>
Generally, I love to dig into whatever interests me as deeply as possible; I get a real kick out of **maximum** customization.<br><br>
I run my own server and personally set up an **Xray VPN**: XHTTP + Nginx + SelfSteal + CDN. I also host my close friend [@ProgrammerKrot](https://github.com/ProgrammerKrot)'s website. I love beautiful 2D tyans and even made my own animated wallpapers for my phone. Currently, I'm rocking a **OnePlus 12, an RTX 5070 TI**, and an **Intel Core 13600KF.**
