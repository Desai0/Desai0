### Zdravstvuyte ðŸ‘‹
I am a student from St. Petersburg, learning in the direction: **Software Development.** <br><br>
Interested in **C++/C#** development, understanding the basics of OOP, I am familiar with Python, JS, Databases (LiteSQL, PostgreSQL), Bash. **I use Arch btw :3**, but have to use Windows too. I study neural networks, I like to work with them locally.<br><br>
Find a lot of fun in phone firmware, **ROOT, custom firmware, magisk modules** and the like. For several years of in-depth work with Android put dozens of custom ROMs, restored soft and hard brick's, lost IMEI, replaced them and many other fun things, it's a pity that now they are tightening the screws and blocking the ability to unlock the bootloader and access to EDL :(. Also worked through the console and Entware with routers, also a lot of custom firmware, overclocking, configuring VPN and fooling equipment to block traffic (zapret).<br>
In general I love to dig into what I am interested in as deeply as possible, I get ecstasy from **maximum** customization.<br><br>
I own my own server and personally configured **Xray VPN**: XHTTP + Nginx + SelfSteal + CDN. I host my close friend [@ProgrammerKrot](https://github.com/ProgrammerKrot)'s website.
Love beautiful artwork 2d pulls and made myself animated wallpapers on my phone. Now I own **OnePlus 12 and RTX 5070 TI + Intel Core 13600KF.**
